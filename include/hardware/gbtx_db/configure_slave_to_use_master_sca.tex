\subsubsection{Configure slave GBTx DB to use master SCA channel}
\label{sec:hardware-slave-sca}
This setup is required to program a slave via a master SCA channel.
In a typical scenario, the master is connected to a MiniDAQ so that programming
the slave using the MiniDAQ directly\footnote{
    MiniDAQ $\to$ master GBTx $\to$ slave GBTx.
}is possible.
Follow \autoref{fig:master-sca} to connect a slave GBTx to the SCA channel of a
master GBTx DB.
