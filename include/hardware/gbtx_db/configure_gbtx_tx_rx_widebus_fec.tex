\subsubsection{
    Configure GBTx DB in transmitter/transceiver and widebus/FEC mode
}
GBTx DBs can be configured to operate as a transmitter or a transceiver, with
a communication protocol of widebus or FEC, by hardware pins.
There are a total of 4 pins;
these related pins are shown in \autoref{fig:gbt-txrx}.

GBTx operations mode is completely determined by these 4 pins (corresponding to
4 bits). The 4-bit operation modes are listed in \nameref{appx:4bit}.
