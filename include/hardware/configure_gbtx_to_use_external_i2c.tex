\subsection{Configure GBTx to use external \itwoc adapter}
Follow \autoref{fig:external_i2c} to connect an external \itwoc adapter to the
GBTx board.

\begin{leftbar}
    The \itwoc adapter used in our lab is made in-house.
    For the 2x1 connector, make sure the side that has \emph{no} metal contact
    is facing up.
