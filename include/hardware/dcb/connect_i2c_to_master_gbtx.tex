\subsection{Connect \itwoc adapter to DCB master GBTx}
\label{sec:dcb-master-i2c}
A FFC breakout board is needed to connect \itwoc adapter to the DCB GBTx master.
Follow \autoref{fig:dcb_mc_i2c} to connect an external \itwoc adapter.

    Pay attention to the implied orientation of the breakout board, as it is
    helpful to locate pin 1.
