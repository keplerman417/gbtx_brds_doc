\subsubsection{Manually pull up \texttt{TX\_RDY}}
DCB pilot boards have a design flaw that prevents them pulling up
\texttt{TX\_RDY} automatically.
This would prevent PRBS tests, since without it pulling up, MiniDAQ would
consider data frames as ``invalid''\footnote{
    Which is not really the case, as all \texttt{TX\_RDY} does is flip single
    bit 0 to 1 on the header part of the data frame.
}.

A large ($\approx$ 5~k$\Omega$) resistor is connected to the \emph{data GBTx}
FFC breakout boards.
See \autoref{fig:dcb_tx_rdy_pull_up} for connection details.
