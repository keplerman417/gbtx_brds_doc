\subsubsection{Manually pull up \texttt{TX\_DATAVALID}}
DCB pilot boards do not have pull-up resistor to pull up \texttt{TX\_DATAVALID}
automatically.
This would prevent PRBS tests, since without it pulling up, MiniDAQ would
consider data frames as ``invalid''\footnote{
    Which is not really the case, as all \texttt{TX\_DATAVALID} does is flip
    single bit 0 to 1 on the header part of the data frame.
}.

A large ($\approx$ 5~k$\Omega$) resistor is connected between the \emph{data
GBTx} FFC breakout board \texttt{TX\_DATAVALID} pin and 1.5~V rail.
See \autoref{fig:dcb_tx_datavalid_pull_up} for connection details.

    Manually pull up \texttt{TX\_DATAVALID} with a large resistor.
    Here we are lazy, because we are using \texttt{TX\_RDY} to provide 1.5 V.
    This is strictly not recommended, but it works, and it creates less clutter
    in the setup.
