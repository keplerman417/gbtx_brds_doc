\subsection{Connect \itwoc adapter to DCB data GBTxs}
\label{sec:dcb-data-i2c}
\itwoc adapter can be connected to the DCB mainboard directly, so that all 6
data GBTxs can be accessed via \itwoc.
Note that a FFC breakout board \emph{is still required} in this case, as no
ground connector is present on the mainboard and must be connected to any of the
4 FFC breakout boards.
Follow \autoref{fig:dcb-data-i2c} to connect an external \itwoc
adapter\footnote{
    As a reminder, in UMD, \itwoc adapter color coding is:
    yellow $\rightarrow$ \texttt{I2C SCL};
    blue $\rightarrow$ \texttt{I2C SDA};
}.

    \itwoc adapter can be connected on the DCB mainboard to access all 6 data
    GBTxs.
    Also note that no \texttt{GND} is present thus FFC breakout board is still
    required.
