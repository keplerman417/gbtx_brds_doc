\subsection{Configure GBTx to use GBT-IC channel}
It might be useful to read/write individual registers from/to a GBTx board. In
this case, follow the \autoref{fig:gbt-ic} to flip the \texttt{configSelect}
switch.

\begin{leftbar}
    Flip the \texttt{configSelect} switch will render the external \itwoc
    adapter ineffective.
    None of the GBTx register value is fused onto the board, so a GBTx board in
    our lab must always be programmed externally via \itwoc before flipping the
    switch.
\end{leftbar}
