\section{Safety}
Safety is the most important thing in a lab. Please follow institutional guidelines.
In addition, the MiniDAQ server uses standard 110 V AC power. Please be careful
when handling this voltage.
The MiniDAQ server is also heavy, when removing it from the rack at least two
persons are needed and must proceed with caution.

To make sure no board is damaged accidentally, please:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Always wear ESD-safe straps.
    \item Place all boards on an ESD-safe desktop.
    \item Handle the board with caution to avoid dropping.
    \item Install connectors gently to avoid bending or damaging them.
    \item When disconnecting components it is preferable to wiggle them parallel
        to the long axis rather than the short axis of the pinout.
    \item Always double check the power supply output parameter before turn them
        on or connect them to boards. Make sure these parameters are correct.
\end{itemize}
