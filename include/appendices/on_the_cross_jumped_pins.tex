\subsection{On the cross-jumped DCB pins}
\label{sec:cross_jumper}
Upon receiving DCB boards, one should notice a pair of (handmade) wire on the
board that cross-jump the \texttt{J12} configurator, as shown in
\autoref{fig:cross_jumper}.

Due to a design oversight, we flipped the \texttt{SCL} and \texttt{SDA}
connections, so we have to cross jump them.
This will be fixed in final production board.

    These cables may fail.
    If one cannot program data GBTxs with GBT client, check the resistance of
    these cables.
