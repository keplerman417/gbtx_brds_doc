\subsection{On the cross-jumped DCB pins}
\label{appx:cross-jumper}
Upon receiving DCB boards, one should notice a pair of (handmade) wire on the
board that cross-jumps the \texttt{J12} configurator pins, as shown in
\autoref{fig:cross-jumper}.

Due to a design oversight, \texttt{SCL} and \texttt{SDA} connections were
flipped, so it has to be cross-jumped.
This will be fixed in final production board.

    These cables may fail.
    If one cannot program data GBTxs with GBT client, check the resistance of
    these cables.
