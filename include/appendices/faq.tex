\Que{
    I cannot communicate with my board via I2C/GBT/etc. How to fix it?
}
\Ans{
    ``Have you tried to turn it off and turn it back on again?''
}

\Que{
    How can I fix ``Waiting for a GBT server to run'' on the MiniDAQ?
}
\Ans{
    Sometimes when we launch the \textbf{GBT Client}, it would claim that it is
    ``Waiting for a GBT server to run''.
    Take this warning literally:
    It means that currently there is no GBT server that is alive.
    The fix is easy: fire up a terminal, and type in ``\texttt{GbtServ}''.
}

\Que{
    I received error message \texttt{0x8000} when I try to program data GBTxs via
    GBT client. What should I do?
}
\Ans{
    As described in \autoref{sec:cross_jumper}, these handmade cable jumpers may
    fail.
    Measure the resistance of these cables to make sure they remain cables.
