\subsection{Flip MiniDAQ Tx polarity}
Due to a design flaw of the pilot DCB, its input polarity is flipped.
We can workaround this issue by flipping the MiniDAQ Tx polarity on certain
channels.

To do that, open the FSM main panel, then click \textbf{LLI...}.
A panel similar to \autoref{fig:minidaq-lli} should show up.
Tick channels that should have their polarity flipped, then click
\textbf{Apply}.

    This setting is \emph{non-persistent}!
    Please re-apply desired settings to MiniDAQ after each reboot.
