\subsection{Watchdog and timeout}
According to GBTX manual, watchdog will monitor the state of each sub-block, and
will reset any malfunctioning sub-block; timeout treats sub-blocks that don't
report a state back (after 2 seconds) as malfunctioning.

\begin{leftbar}
    Timeout is applied to the following states:
    \texttt{waitXPLLLock}, \texttt{waitDESLock}, \texttt{waitRXEPLLLock},
    \texttt{waitSERLock}, \texttt{waitTXEPLLLock}, \texttt{waitdllLocked}.
\end{leftbar}

Watchdog is enabled by setting 2-0 bits in register \texttt{0x32} (decimal 50)
to ``111''. Timeout is enabled by setting 5-3 bits in register \texttt{0x34}
(decimal 52) to ``111''.

In the provided \texttt{master-*.txt} configurations, both watchdog and timeout
are enabled by default. Register \texttt{0x32} has a default value of
\texttt{0x7}, \texttt{0x34} has a default value of \texttt{0x3f}.
