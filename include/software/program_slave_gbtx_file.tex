\subsection{Program slave GBTx with configuration files}
The setup is exactly the same as shown in
\autoref{sec:software-slave-individual}.
All we need to change are replace the \textbf{Size} field with ``0'', and
provide the configuration file location with the following syntax, which needs
to be filled in the \textbf{Data in} field:

\begin{minted}[frame=single]{powershell}
file:<path_to_configuration_file>
\end{minted}

\begin{leftbar}
    This is equivalent to program the slave with an external \itwoc adapter.
    The advantage of doing this way is we don't need to remove the \itwoc
    adapter from the master.
    In other words, once the hardware setup is done, we don't have to touch them
    anymore; whereas if we program both master and slave with an \itwoc adapter,
    it must be moved around between the master and the slave.
\end{leftbar}
