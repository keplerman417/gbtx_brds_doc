\subsection{Program slave GBTx with configuration files}
The setup is exactly the same as shown in
\autoref{sec:software-slave-individual}.
All we need to change are replace the \textbf{Size} field with ``0'', and
provide the configuration file location with the following syntax, which needs
to be filled in the \textbf{Data in} field:

\begin{minted}[frame=single]{powershell}
file:<path_to_configuration_file>
\end{minted}
